Project Name: Proxy Project

Project Description: A project to demonstrate a socket server handling multiple clients routing traffic through the server.

How you plan to utilize the Client/Server architecture: Clients will be able to connect to the server and access the internet in a standard fashion

Goals/Features:

Client will be able to cleanly connect to the server
Client will be able to cleanly disconnect from the server
Client will be able to reconnect to the server
Server will be able to route traffic through the server and pass the data back to the clients
The clients will gracefully handle the server getting shutdown and will exit themselves.
The clients will have a standalone UI to interact with instead of running from the command line or IDE.

Reach goals: (Please provide at least two things you'd like to try to attempt. These will add to your grade if it works, otherwise it won't impact)

Clients will be able to choose a particular server to connect to.
Clients can wait for a set duration to try to reconnect to the server.
